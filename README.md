qCamera
=======

qCamera is a unified camera interface meant to be used in experimental
control systems such as qControl. It is designed to have commands for
cameras be as generic as possible to the user, that way swapping out
physical cameras should require little more than changing a line of
code to reflect the new hardware.

Supported cameras
-----------------

Not all SDK features of supported cameras are necessarily
implemented. Currently, cameras supported by qCamera include:

* [Andor](http://www.andor.com/) cameras
  * Development is focused on the iXon line, so there could be some
    issues with other Andor cameras.
* [PCO](http://www.pco.de/) Sensicam
* [Thorlabs](http://www.thorlabs.de)
  [DCx-series](http://www.thorlabs.de/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=DCx)
  CCD/CMOS cameras
* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) generic camera interface (partial support)

Requirements
------------

qCamera at the moment is generally limited to working on Windows only
with most cameras, though this should not be difficult to allow
functionality on Linux where camera SDKs exist. Apart from having the
shared libraries for the cameras being used installed in the proper
location, the following Python packages are required:

* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/)

Optional requirements which if not met will result in limited
functionality:

* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) for running tests
* [PyQt4](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/) for embedding in
  GUI applications. This may be replaced with
  [PyQt5](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/) in the future.
* [GUIQwt](https://pythonhosted.org/guiqwt/) for image widgets in
  tests.

All of these are contained in the default installation of
[Python(x,y)](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) for Windows.

Installation
------------

`python setup.py install`

Don't forget to rerun this whenever you want to import new changes!

TODO
----

* Verify that all docstrings are up to date and accurately reflecting
  arguments, class attributes, etc.
* Make a second thread class that doesn't depend on Qt.

Issues
------

* The ring buffer has problems if the image size changes. This needs
  to be addressed so that binning can be changed and images are still
  recorded to the buffer properly.
